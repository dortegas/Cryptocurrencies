# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they asked us for a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

For this report, we used a dataset from the CryptoCompare site, which was not ideal and was necessary a preprocess data to fit the machine learning models. Since there was no known output for what we were looking for, we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we decided on a clustering algorithm. Finally, we used data visualizations to share findings
